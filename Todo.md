- Responsiveness
    - On mobile view iphone, padding right is whitespace because there's no scrollbar on mobile
        - Bug that makes it look like no padding is applied to the right side of header
        - seems to occur when the app is opened in desktop mode then shrunk to mobile view
        - specificlaly happens on Chrome not sure why
